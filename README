Q. If you had an extra two weeks for this project, what feature(s) would you 
   add.
	==> I would add pictures/photos for the menus provided so that the user 
	    can actually look and will know what they expect. I would also 
	    like to create a whole website for this store, creating multiple
	    pages with the location, about page, etc. 

Q. The thing I like best about Javascript is ... 
	==> That it does not have pointers and confusing data structures. I am
		in a data structures class but it's very different when pointers
		are involved. The concept is relatively easy to understand.
